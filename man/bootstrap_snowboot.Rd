\title{Snowball Sampling (Labeled Snowball with multiple inclusions)}
\usage{
bootstrap_snowboot(
  network,
  B,
  num.seed = NA,
  num.wave = NA,
  output.type = "igraph"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network}{An igraph object with \eqn{n} nodes.}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap samples}

\item{num.seed}{Number of seeds to be included each the snowball sample}

\item{num.wave}{Number of waves to be included each the snowball sample}

\item{output.type}{The class of object the resulting bootstrap networks should be.
The default is \code{igraph} which will make bootstrap samples of class "igraph". Note that for large \eqn{B}, this may not be an efficient use of storage space.
Other options include \code{edgelist} which returns an edge list for each bootstrap sample,
\code{matrix} which returns bootstrap samples as an \eqn{n}-by-\eqn{n} adjacency matrix,
\code{dgCMatrix} which returns sparse matrices (package \code{Matrix} must be loaded).}
}
\value{
A list of length \eqn{B} where each element is an bootstrap sample.
Each element is of class \code{output.type}.
}
\description{
CITE snowboot package
CITE Gel et al paper + Thompson et al paper
}
\details{
This is a modified version of the lsmi function in the snowboot package.
This function uses the node names, not node IDs,
and it returns the edge list of the bootstrap sample, not the nodes included
