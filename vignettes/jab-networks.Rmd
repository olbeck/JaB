In this vignette, we discuss the Jackknife-after-Bootstrap (JaB) algorithm for influential nodes in networks. The JaB algorithm for regression data was proposed by @martin-roberts-2013 and further studied in @beyaztas-alin-2013. Here we expand this methodology to network data. 


## Centrality Statitics


JaB for regression uses outlier, leverage, and influence statistics to detect influential points. See `vignette("jab-regression")`. In network data, centrality statistics are used to quantify influence. Just as there are many definitons of
